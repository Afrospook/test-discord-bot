# test-discord-bot
Me learning Python properly and messing around with a bot
Along all of what was written, was trying to add a specific command to get this bot to return a list of games that all online people are actively playing 
(I know discord already does this this but I wanted to try and get the bot to do it because curiosity to try). Any pointers as to why I couldn't would be appreciated
