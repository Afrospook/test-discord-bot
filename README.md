# test-discord-bot
Me learning Python properly and messing around with a bot
Along all of what was written, was trying to add a specific command to get this bot to return a list of games that all online people are actively playing 
(I know discord already does this this but I wanted to try and get the bot to do it because curiosity to try). Me and regular expressions aren't the best of friends so I'm wondering if it may have something to with that. 
Otherwise if anyone has any pointers as to the above problem or any other stuff wouuld be very appreciated
